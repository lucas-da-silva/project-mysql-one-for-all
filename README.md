# Welcome to the One For All project repository!

## Introduction

Second project I develop using MySQL. The goal was to create a Spotify database, but of course, very simplified and enter data into it from a denormalized spreadsheet. Queries were also developed to select and filter the data.

## Instructions for running docker-compose:

<details>
<summary>Instructions</summary>

> You need docker and docker-compose installed on the machine.

1. Clone the repository
2. Enter the repository folder you just cloned:
  * `cd project-mysql-one-for-all`
3. With docker and docker-compose installed, run the command `docker-compose up -d` to create the MySQL container and start it.
4. Run the `docker ps` command to check if the container is running.
5. Now open MySQL Workbench and connect to the container with the following information:
  * Hostname: `localhost`
  * Port: `3306`
  * Username: `root`
  * Password: `password`
6. Ready! Now you can run the SQL commands that are in the [`challenges`](./challenges/) directory to create the database and insert the data.
7. Run the `docker-compose down` command to stop and remove the container.

## Project development

Initially, I normalized the data from the spreadsheet developed by [Trybe](https://github.com/tryber).

- [Denormalized worksheet](/SpotifyClone-Non-NormalizedTable.xlsx)
- [Worksheet after I normalize](/SpotifyClone-NormalizedTable.xlsx)

I created a database with the necessary tables and inserted the data into it.

- In the file [challenge1.sql](./challenges/challenge1.sql) are the commands for creating tables and inserting data.

In the challenge files, I created queries to answer some challenges created by Trybe.
